Lox implementation using new (or new-ish) Java features:
- Records
- Sealed types
- Pattern matching

This is an adaptation of Bob Nystrom's implementation in _Crafting Interpreters_, chapters 3-13.

Each folder chN will contain my code corresponding to chapters 3 through N. For example, folder ch09 contains my code corresponding to chapters 3-9.
